BYLICKILABS repositories for everyone – from beginners to advanced users!

Good news for those who have little or no experience with Python but still want to use my projects:

I've developed a fully automated Windows installation script that handles all the steps – from downloading to the complete installation of Python.

This means that even absolute beginners without any technical knowledge can now easily use any of my Python applications.

--- To start the script, right-click on it and select:

• (Run as administrator).

---
⚠️🚨 ATTENTION! 🚨⚠️
In some cases, the installer may get stuck 🛑 or, under certain circumstances, it may take longer to start ⏳⚙️.

This can happen, for example, if the installation process is very slow or the system isn't running correctly. This can be caused by:
• ⚙️ Windows settings
• 🔥 Firewall blocks
• 🛡️ Antivirus or security programs
• 🚫 Blocked background processes
👉 If this happens:

Stop the script ❌

and complete the installation manually 🖱️📥.


``` Download from the official website (direct link):
• https://www.python.org/.../3.14.1/python-3.14.1-amd64.exe

🔧 What the installation script does for you:
✔ Automatically downloads the correct Python version
✔ Automatically copies the installer to your desktop
✔ Automatically performs the entire installation
✔ Optimally prepares Windows for all my Python projects

---
🔒 Data privacy & user control:

For security reasons, it's important that you briefly confirm which options are being installed in the Python installer itself.

In most cases, this simply means:

• ➡️ "Next" → "Install" → "Finish"
This way, you retain full control over your system at all times.

---

🧩 Virtual Environment (venv)
Some of my projects require a virtual Python environment – ​​the necessary functions are already included in Python and don't need to be installed separately.

Depending on the repository, you'll find either:

✔ an automatic .bat file
The .bat file performs the following steps, for example:

• create venv
• activate venv
• install requirements
• start the application
💡 And the best part:

All .bat files can be easily started with a double-click.

No need to open a terminal or enter any commands – Windows does everything automatically.

Or
✔ an easy-to-understand .txt document
with clear, step-by-step instructions for all processes.

---

📦 Install dependencies via "requirements.txt"
The file `requirements.txt` is located in every repository.

After downloading:

Right-click in the project folder
• "Open in Terminal"
Run the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
This will automatically install all necessary modules in Python.

--
▶️ How to start a Python application?

In the terminal within the project directory, simply:

`python app.py`

- or - depending on the project structure:

`python main.py`

---

🗄️ Automatic databases in some applications
Some of my applications automatically create a local database to:

• Save settings
• Store application logs
• Back up workflows
• Keep file-specific content available
These databases are created and managed automatically.

You don't need to configure or install them.

---

🔐 100% Local – No Cloud, No Server, No Tracking

All BYLICKILABS Python applications:

• Never send any data to my server
• Never connect to a cloud
• Never perform any external transfers
• Work exclusively locally on your own system
• Your data belongs to you – and stays with you.

🟩 Suitable even for complete beginners
✔ Everything can be started via terminal or double-click
✔ Many projects have an automatic .bat launcher
✔ No complicated commands necessary
✔ No prior knowledge required
✔ Installation & setup almost fully automatic
✔ Virtual environments are also provided via .bat

Thanks to the new installation script and automated process files, all users – from beginners to power users – can immediately and fully utilize the BYLICKILABS Python repositories.

👉 Download
👉 Unzip
👉 Install the requirements or

👉 Run the script or .bat file
👉 Get started right away
📌 Additional short post: Why I prefer Python

🐍 Python – demanding, but extremely powerful
--- For many, Python seems like (Huh?) or a big (?), but when used professionally, it's one of the best and most efficient scripting languages ​​available.

--- I prefer Python because it allows you to:
• Solve highly complex tasks extremely quickly
• Efficiently develop security and analysis mechanisms
• Flexibly integrate AI functions
• Cleanly implement automations and system tools
• Build both small tools and enterprise systems
No other language combines elegance

That's why Python is the first choice for many of my projects.
